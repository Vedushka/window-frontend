# window-frontend

This project creates a webpage where users can draw a rectangle SVG figure, resize it using the mouse, and display its perimeter. The initial dimensions of the SVG figure are taken from a JSON file, and after resizing, the system updates the JSON file with the new dimensions. The frontend is implemented using Angular, and the backend for JSON saving is implemented in C# through an API.
